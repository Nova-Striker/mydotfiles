  Mysql related changes
  ------
  
  4. Changed the default `auth_socket` passwd identification to `caching_sha2_password` to make it compatible to use with beekeeper studio. See [this](https://github.com/beekeeper-studio/beekeeper-studio/issues/405#issue-728431491)
  
  5. Step 4 broke mysql server and now it cannot be used from shell. 
  It can now be used with only Beekeeper. Looking for a solution to fix this for the time being.
